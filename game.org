Here is what I think I want the game to be.

Multiplayer (eventuially)

You control a guy, he can interact and train animals in the world. Animals are not real animals tho, they are just little iconic things like that game exo.

Multiplayer combat maybe, maybe coop and you have to go fight hard guys or do stuff that requires you to train different animals for different purposes.

This can be combinatorically strong, with various effects and stuff, could also even make better art later if I really wanted to.


we'll have a player with player movement.
For interactions we'll have a way to click them and pick an action from a right stick select menu.
This should work on ipad too, letting us just tap the thing we want.

what do I need in my controller then?

maybe drones or something can let you communicate from not yourself
psycic linking or something dope

wasd for movement
right click, left click for giving orders and selecting units.
(triggers and shoulder buttons might work here too)
menu for training and orders, needs thinking to work on ios pc and xbox
couple other buttons maybe, a b x y, q e f shift

mouse position and clicks
mmo because you have orders, can be played async

wasd, clicks, mouse position, drags
ipad will be similar, 
I really want building to be a part of the game. Freeform building like in minecraft. You can build a castle and assign guards to it and another player can try to attack you.

think like an ipad tho.
